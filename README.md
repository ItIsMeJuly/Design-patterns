# Design-patterns
<p>In this repo We have one designed state machine for a bread bake machine and one for an elevator.
<ul>
  <li>Breadbake</li>
  The breadbake state machine has 5 different modes:
  Bread, Bread+, Rapid program, Dough< Bake only. The design is for a real baking machine that makes the whole bread manually by doing sequencial activities. For example a full cycle includes:
  <ol>
  <li>Delayed start
  <li>Kneading of the dough and optional automatic add of yeast and extra ingredients (in Bread+).
  <li>Rising
  <li>Baking
  </ol>
  <li>Elevator
  The elevator is built for a building with 20 floors where there are 8 elevators that are controlled. By clicking a button the user requests an elevator and the system picks the closest one to user regarding which direction he is going.
 </ul>
